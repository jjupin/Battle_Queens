Battle Queens

This is an interactive solution to the classic N-Queens problem.  The problem is to place N Queens on an N x N board.  
The minimum size is 4 queens since anything smaller does not allow for the placement of the queens without killing at least one queen.
This app allows the user to select how many queens to place and generates the appropriately sized board.  The puzzle also includes
the ability to enable "Einstein" mode which will show the next square to select to assist in the solution.  Additionally, the user
can turn on "Free Squares" or "Available Squares" - these are squares on the board that a queen placed on it will not be in danger
of being killed by any other queen on the board.  Einstein mode will also inform the user when it cannot place any other queen since
no solution is possible given the current configuration of place queens.
